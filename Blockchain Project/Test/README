peep.c: This fucntion will implement all of the previous programs that we made before and implement them into peep.c.
        Based on the usr input that the user gives us, we cna read and detemrine what we need to do to the peep. We can
        make a new peep, edit a peep get the peep at a certain timestamp, get the entire peep, and verify the peep. 

peepEditor.c: This fucntion has everything to do with our editing. We will have the user interface and from there, get the 
              users input on whatr they want to do with the peep. they can either add to the peep, delete something in the peep,
              view the characters, and save their progress and exit

blockChain.c: This will have all of the hashing fucntions implemented into it. It will also give us the alogrithm and program 
              for the merkleTree root. All helper fucntions will be found there as well. 

design.txt: the design.txt is an explanation of each of our functions and what they do. This file also
            describes the decisions we made and why we made them as well as an issues list that shows 
            what issues we had throughout the project and how we solves it

Makefile: The makefile is going to compile everything before being run

Tests: This si a directory that will have all of our testing it it and ran to ensure our functions are working properly.
